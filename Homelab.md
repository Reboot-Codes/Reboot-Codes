# Homelab Structure
This is probably not up to date as I make changes a lot. 
Yes, all of the device codenames are from norse mythology.

## Codename Keys:
```yaml
NetworkAndStuff:
  Asguard: Network
  Odin: PC(s)
  Thor: Laptop(s)
  Loki: Tablet(s)
  Mjonir: Phone(s)
  Valkyrie:
    "S#": "Server running software that isn't dependant on a lot of storage (usually running Rancher)."
    "N#": "Server running software that is dependant on a lot of storage (usually running TrueNAS)."
   allNetworkedVMs: "Virtual Machines I need access to all over my network, which aren't many."
PublicFacing:
  domain: "Signifies my domain (e.g. reboothasstuff.co or something). Shown as: hostedThing (desc: hostedThing.domain)"
```

## At the moment:
```txt
H Cox/ISP (Modem/WAN Connection)
S   Reboot (My network user)
H     Laptop (thor.local)
H     iPad (loki.local)
H     iPhone (mjonir.local)
H     Rasperry Pi 3B+ (valkyire.local)
S       Gitlab ("I was going to use Gitea, but it didn't have builtin CI/CD" -me: git.domain)
S       Uptime Kuma (Like uptimerobot, but selfhosted: uptime.domain)
S       Guacamole (VNC + HTTPS: guacamole.domain)
S       Home Asistant (Smart Home Hub on Sterioids: hass.domain)
```
