# My setup

I choose to ignore a lot of things, as they aren't used for development much. 

- `Fira Code NF` as a font for everything that needs to be monospaced
- M1 MacBook Pro (2020)
  - Base model, silver
- Applications
  - Visual Studio Code
    - Atom One Dark as a theme
    - TabNine as an auto complete engine
    - _And about 60 other extensions that I don't have the time to write here._
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (For testing containers)
  - [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com), and more terminal stuff
    - A heavily edited installation of Zsh. ([OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh) using [P10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) as the theme.)
    - [N](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) as a Node.js version manager.
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as my Node.js package manager.
    - [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) as my main package manager.
    - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) because it's a very simple way to create repos for all of the projects _fast_!
    - Python 3.9 for more advanced scripting and automation
    - A few custom utility scripts
      - `airbnb-react-guidelines`: A script to add AirBnb ESLint settings to CRA projects, [source here](https://gist.github.com/03936d30e0a70627170f9fef5f3dcd49).
      - `finder`: A script that passes in all arguments to `open -a Finder.app`
      - `crazybrew`: A script to access an Intel install of [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh).
      - `superclear`: Clear terminal, run neofetch, good for "rice"-ing (I guess).
  - [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) (spotlight on crack)
  - [Notion](https://notion.so) For all the planing
  - [Figma](https://figma.com), UI design app (free).
