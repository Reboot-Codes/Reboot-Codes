Hi there! I'm a student (future CS major) who likes to make things using computers. I really don't finish projects ever though (I know, that's a bad habit, sorry...). Also all of the shields that I use are from [shields.io](https://shields.io).

You can find me in lot's of places on the internet. A lot of my projects are a bit _unfinished_, but feel free to look around. Check out [Setup.md](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/Reboot-Codes/blob/main/Setup.md) for a sense of all the stuff I use (not up to date). I'm also working on a homelab, which you can find the info on at [Homelab.md](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/Reboot-Codes/blob/main/Homelab.md).
