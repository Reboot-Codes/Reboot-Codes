Hi there! I'm a student (future CS major) who likes to make things using computers. I really don't finish projects ever though (I know, that's a bad habit, sorry...). Also all of the shields that I use are from [shields.io](https://shields.io).

You can find me in lot's of places on the internet. Here are some of my main projects (Some are private, will probably be made public soon):
- [DevClone (A clone of DEV.to using the MERN stack.)](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/DevClone)
- [ReUtils (A general utility plugin for Minecraft servers.)](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/ReUtils)
- [AGSifPS (Automated Google Sign in for Python Selenium)](https://gist.github.com/fcbb76cb2ab13043d62eaf53ef3e97e1)

> Please note: Some of my projects are configured for UNIX systems (specifically macOS running on an M1 MacBook Pro), and may need some tweaking to work on other systems. Specifically, a `#!` statement will use a specific version of a package installed using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), which you probably don't have in the same location.

Check out [Setup.md](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/Reboot-Codes/blob/main/Setup.md) for a complete list of the stuff on my computer (it's _really_ long)!
