Hi there! I'm a student (future CS major) who likes to make things using computers. I really don't finish projects ever though.

You can find me in lot's of places on the internet. Here are some of my main projects (Some are private, will probably be made public soon):
- [DevClone (A clone of DEV.to using the MERN stack.)](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/DevClone)
- [ReUtils (A general utility plugin for Minecraft servers.)](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/ReUtils)
- [AGSifPS (Automated Google Sign in for Python Selenium)](https://gist.github.com/fcbb76cb2ab13043d62eaf53ef3e97e1)
